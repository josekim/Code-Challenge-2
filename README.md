# Code-Challenge-2

## Description
This was a code challenge that I received back in March that I am redoing.  A Data.json file and a organizer_mock.png file were given to me to build a website using React.  I decided re-attempt this exercise to work on using react to build out a website after learning something new things about react. Learned some of these techniques from [Brian Holt's react course](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react/) 

9/13 - Since this is the beginning - Currently it only produces a "hello World"

## Dependencies

To look at what I have so far put in the following commands 

```
yarn 
yarn build
yarn start    // this should start up a server that you can access from  http://localhost:8080/
```
